        'Most of the observable “problems” are framed as user friction and capability gaps rather than explicit complaints. Dimi Mikadze repeatedly positions his content around the idea that many people are underusing ChatGPT at work and are missing practical features that would make day to day tasks easier, which implies a recurring pain point of wasted effort and inefficient workflows when teams do not know the right features or patterns to use. This shows up in the posts that focus on “features worth knowing” and “useful features you might not be using yet,” both aimed at closing a knowledge and adoption gap rather than debating AI at a high level. [post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7361301965022150658/) [post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7358377857074577409/)\n\nA second implied pain point is the difficulty of doing company research quickly and consistently at scale, which he addresses by building and open sourcing an agentic system that takes a website URL and returns a full company profile, then later emphasizing that it has expanded from research into end to end workflows. The repeated emphasis on automation and scale indicates that manual research and one off processes are a core frustration he is actively solving through productized engineering work.

        'Recent authored posting is dominated by two threads: shipping and iterating on an open source agentic AI system (Mira), and distributing practical AI education content via YouTube tied to workplace use cases. The Mira thread is visible in the initial open source announcement and the later update describing rapid capability growth from research into broader workflows, with follow up comments repeatedly directing readers to a GitHub repo and a video walkthrough, which indicates active building and evangelizing rather than a one time release. [post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7365639131323863040/) [post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7378306963828441088/)\n\nThe education thread is visible in the launch of a YouTube channel for business leaders and subsequent posts that promote a video and slides on ChatGPT features with concrete work tasks like reviewing contracts, cleaning spreadsheets, and simulating client conversations. The behavior of placing the video link in comments and asking for feedback on how others use AI suggests a current focus on building an audience and feedback loop around applied AI workflows.

        'Open source and shareability are consistently reinforced as a value through repeated calls to “open sourced,” “free,” and “easy to customize,” plus immediate distribution of the GitHub repository in the comments on the key Mira posts. The pattern is not just announcing work, but making it inspectable and reusable, which is a concrete behavioral signal of valuing transparency and community enabled iteration. [post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7365639131323863040/) [post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7378306963828441088/)\n\nPracticality over hype is also consistently emphasized. Even when discussing broad tools like ChatGPT, he frames content around “real examples,” “quick walkthrough,” and specific workflows rather than abstract trends, and he positions the channel explicitly as helping business leaders use AI in “simple, practical ways.” That repeated positioning shows a value for utility and execution focused learning.

The Mira posts describe an agentic AI system that automates company research from a website URL to a full profile, and later describe an expansion into full workflows, which demonstrates hands on engineering and iteration rather than only commentary on AI trends. His behavior of consistently linking the code repository and walkthroughs indicates the work is reproducible and detailed enough to warrant external inspection.

He lists multiple business tasks he uses ChatGPT for and formats the content as slides and a video walkthrough, which suggests strength in translating tool capability into operational habits. At the same time, the posts as provided do not include technical implementation details, benchmarks, or architecture discussion in the feed text itself, so the demonstrated depth there is practical and use case oriented rather than engineering deep dives.

The most conversational move is inviting others to share how they use AI, but most posts primarily present what was built or what is useful, suggesting he treats LinkedIn as a release and teaching channel more than a debate or discussion forum.

Across multiple posts, his own comments are dominated by the video walkthrough and GitHub links, with only a brief gratitude response to a commenter, which reinforces a broadcast plus resource sharing style.

The gap is that, in day to day LinkedIn behavior, a substantial share of his authored activity is not about sales intelligence specifically but about general ChatGPT capability education for business leaders, indicating that his attention is split between building agentic systems and acting as an educator for broad workplace AI adoption.

I found that home at Hilltop Partner Network.\n\nI am honored to step into the role of Chief Technology Officer (CTO).\nA huge thank you to Geoff Besko, Renée Riglin, and the leadership team for betting on a newcomer and trusting me with the technical vision. And to the engineering crew - thank you for making me look good every day.\n\nWe have a lot of "cooking" to do in 2026. Let\'s get to work. 🏗️',

      text: 'I just made a pleasant discovery 🤓 \n\nI asked ChatGPT to deep research and map the global photobooth market from different angles. I expected the usual list of manufacturers, rental companies, and 360 rigs.\n\nWhile reading the results, I noticed something unexpected:\nPrintomato 🍅 showed up as part of the market landscape as "a market gap and unmet needs". Not because the system “knows” me, but because our model now appears in public sources as a new category.\n\n1. A venue device instead of a rental booth.\n2. Free prints covered by ads.\n3. Always-on placement for bars, cafes, and hotels.\n& Still almost no direct alternatives globally.\n\nFrankly, seeing our product appear in neutral research gave me a different perspective. It felt like looking at the industry from the outside and spotting the gap we decided to fill.\n\nIt’s a small thing, but it shows that the work is starting to leave a mark.\n\nBuilding something new is slow. Then one day you notice signs that it’s becoming real. 🤫\n\nP.S. You can do this for your own company as well. It’s a quick way to see whether your work is starting to register in the ecosystem.',

More interaction. More personalization. More reasons to stay loyal beyond the game itself.\n\nI’m grateful to the organisers Rasmus Sojmark for building this incredible event, and to all the partners and professionals we’ve shared ideas with. Together, we’re not just networking — we’re shaping what’s next.\n\nAnyone who missed me at the show, please PM to talk for real scale and partnerships through our Tech and Expertise. \n\nNext Stop SBC Summit Tbilisi, See You in Hometown \n\n#promofyai #aigamification #retention #sbc #lisbon #innovation #loyalty',

      text: "Marking a new professional chapter here in Canada (details coming soon) with my first pay stub brought on a classic newcomer moment: the tax rate.\n\nIt would be easy to complain. But instead of getting stuck on the numbers, my tech-focused mind decided to reframe it.\n\n👉 I'm not paying taxes. I've subscribed to 'Canada Premium'.\n\nWhen you look at it that way, the feature list is fascinating:\n\n- Core Service: Endless perspectives, world-class education, beautiful nature, freedom of self-expression and the list goes on.\n- The Canada Child Benefit? It's Referral Bonus: The commission for bringing new users (my kids) to the platform.\n- The pension plan? It's a Loyalty Program. The best cash-back program on the market.\n\nAll jokes aside, this simple mental shift from \"cost\" to \"investment\" has been powerful. It's a constant reminder of the value we get in return and the society we are all collectively building. It turns an obligation into a stake in the outcome.\n\nWhether you're a newcomer still figuring things out or you've been a \"subscriber\" for generations, I'm curious - how do you perceive it?\n\n#LifeInCanada #Newcomer #Taxes #Mindset #Winnipeg #PersonalFinance",

I expected just a handful of people, but more than 40 players showed up and filled every slot to test our demo. In hindsight, bringing only two ROG Ally X devices was clearly not enough… I definitely underestimated the turnout! 😅\n\nThe feedback was incredibly insightful and it sparked a wave of new fans joining our Discord, already sharing art, ideas, and a ton of kindness. Moments like these remind me why we are building Tomo: Endless Blue. 💙\n\n(And yes, I may or may not have trolled the Pokémon AZ line by letting people play Tomo while waiting for their demo slot, then interviewing them after they had tried both 🤭)',

Yes, it has way too many features compared to a traditional Civilization game, but the UI simply makes much of the things self-explanatory.” \n“The UI does a lot to make the game quite visually appealing.” \n“If you are a game UI nerd like me, check it out.”\n\nWe’re excited to see Théo apply the same passion for thoughtful design to shaping the future of Gcast.',

      text: "TLDR; 🎮 I built an autotesting framework from scratch, with PlayStation as the main client.\nWant to get autotesting coverage on your games or improve what you have? Let's talk!\n\nAfter attending the autotesting roundtables at the Game Developers Conference last year, I realized that the video game industry still relies almost entirely on manual testing. For many studios, the idea of having automated testing pipelines and scenarios seems too difficult or unattainable.\n\nBut here’s what I managed to do:\n\n- 🤖 Automate tests on a catalog of 5,000+ games across different environments, running on every commit.\n\n- 🧪 Create a farm of dev kits to test not only on PC, but also on the different consoles on the market.\n\n- ✅ Provide peace of mind to developers, as manual testers are unable to ensure non-regression with every single commit.\n\n- 🧑‍💻 Give both developers and QA teams an easy way to create their own tests and add them to the pipeline.\n\n- 🔬 Achieve a certain testing power by comparing images, audio, performance, logs, and more.\n\nUltimately, I had a blast doing this. It's rewarding to build solutions that are uncommon in the industry and see them work—and even realize there's a ton of untapped potential (yeah, I was doing this before ChatGPT, lol).\n\nI'd be really interested in applying my knowledge and experience to your games, whether you're using well-known or proprietary engines!\n\nIf this sounds interesting to you, or you just want to discuss it or compare experiences, I'd be happy to chat! Feel free to ping me on LinkedIn. 😁\n\n#GameDev #AutomatedTesting #QA #DevOps #VideoGames",

A title is just a word. Real partnership is the foundation.\n\nRecognizing early when that alignment isn’t there — and stepping away with clarity — is not a setback. It’s a decision rooted in self-awareness and integrity.\n\nI’m grateful for the clarity this experience has given me and excited to connect with teams where shared values and long-term trust are the starting point.

      text: 'Something I’ve noticed in my first few months here in Winnipeg is how everything is built with wood. It’s fast, flexible, and smells like progress. It’s beautiful. \n\nIt\'s also completely different from where I come from. 😉\n\nBack in Georgia, we build with stone. Our fortresses have stood for over a thousand years. Stone is about permanence, resilience, and deep, unshakeable foundations. It’s heavy. It’s slow. It’s meant to last forever. \n\nThis got me thinking about how we build companies and software. \n\nFor many years in IT, I\'ve worked with both "stone" and "wood". \n\nStone is the legacy monolith, the critical database, the enterprise ERP system you customize... It\'s powerful and reliable, but a nightmare to change. \n\nWood is the agile microservice, the React front-end, the serverless function. You can build an MVP in weeks. You can pivot, adapt, and scale quickly. But it requires constant maintenance to weather the storms. \n\nI’ve seen leaders who only love stone, and their companies become fossils. I’ve seen leaders who only love wood, and their platforms collapse in the first high wind. 💨  \n\n💡 The real art is in the architecture. It\'s knowing how to reinforce a stone foundation with a flexible wooden frame. It’s about choosing the right material for the right job, ensuring the whole structure is sound, secure, and ready for the future. \n\nMy journey in Winnipeg feels a bit like this. I\'m a "stone" guy learning to love the craft of building with "wood." It’s a new environment and a new way of thinking. And I’m finding that the principles of building something strong, beautiful, and lasting are universal. \n\nWhat is your company built with? Stone, wood, or a hybrid of both? I\'d love to hear your stories. \n\n#TechLeadership #CTO #SoftwareArchitecture #StartupLife #WinnipegTech #GeorgiaToCanada #Newcomer',
