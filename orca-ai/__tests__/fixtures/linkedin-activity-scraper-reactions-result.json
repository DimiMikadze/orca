Full calendar. Non-stop meetings. Real conversations about the future of engagement, loyalty, and how brands connect with users 🤝\n\n🙏 Thank you to the organisers, judges, partners, and future partners for the trust and belief that what we’re building truly matters.\n\nParis Smith Maxime Sbeghen Jeff Millar Adam Rosenberg Meir Shachar\n\n💜 And above all, this win belongs to our small, united, relentlessly driven team.

    "text": "I just made a pleasant discovery 🤓 \n\nI asked ChatGPT to deep research and map the global photobooth market from different angles. I expected the usual list of manufacturers, rental companies, and 360 rigs.\n\nWhile reading the results, I noticed something unexpected:\nPrintomato 🍅 showed up as part of the market landscape as \"a market gap and unmet needs\". Not because the system “knows” me, but because our model now appears in public sources as a new category.\n\n1. A venue device instead of a rental booth.\n2. Free prints covered by ads.\n3. Always-on placement for bars, cafes, and hotels.\n& Still almost no direct alternatives globally.\n\nFrankly, seeing our product appear in neutral research gave me a different perspective. It felt like looking at the industry from the outside and spotting the gap we decided to fill.\n\nIt’s a small thing, but it shows that the work is starting to leave a mark.\n\nBuilding something new is slow. Then one day you notice signs that it’s becoming real. 🤫\n\nP.S. You can do this for your own company as well. It’s a quick way to see whether your work is starting to register in the ecosystem.",

    "text": "SBC Lisbon and PROMOFY this year was more than just a 3-day marathon of meetings (though it definitely felt like one 😅). \n\nAs I sit here recovered from the inevitable conference virus 🦠, I’m reminded of something simple but powerful: Health always comes first.\n\nEvery meeting opened a door, every conversation sparked an idea, and every opportunity reminded me why we do what we do: building the future of engagement and loyalty. 🚀\n\nOne thought keeps circling in my mind: our industry needs more understanding of gamification than ever. \n\nWalking through the halls, speaking with operators, platform providers, and innovators, one thing became clear: players today expect more. More interaction. More personalization. More reasons to stay loyal beyond the game itself.\n\nI’m grateful to the organisers Rasmus Sojmark for building this incredible event, and to all the partners and professionals we’ve shared ideas with. Together, we’re not just networking — we’re shaping what’s next.\n\nAnyone who missed me at the show, please PM to talk for real scale and partnerships through our Tech and Expertise. \n\nNext Stop SBC Summit Tbilisi, See You in Hometown \n\n#promofyai #aigamification #retention #sbc #lisbon #innovation #loyalty",

    "text": "Marking a new professional chapter here in Canada (details coming soon) with my first pay stub brought on a classic newcomer moment: the tax rate.\n\nIt would be easy to complain. But instead of getting stuck on the numbers, my tech-focused mind decided to reframe it.\n\n👉 I'm not paying taxes. I've subscribed to 'Canada Premium'.\n\nWhen you look at it that way, the feature list is fascinating:\n\n- Core Service: Endless perspectives, world-class education, beautiful nature, freedom of self-expression and the list goes on.\n- The Canada Child Benefit? It's Referral Bonus: The commission for bringing new users (my kids) to the platform.\n- The pension plan? It's a Loyalty Program. The best cash-back program on the market.\n\nAll jokes aside, this simple mental shift from \"cost\" to \"investment\" has been powerful. It's a constant reminder of the value we get in return and the society we are all collectively building. It turns an obligation into a stake in the outcome.\n\nWhether you're a newcomer still figuring things out or you've been a \"subscriber\" for generations, I'm curious - how do you perceive it?\n\n#LifeInCanada #Newcomer #Taxes #Mindset #Winnipeg #PersonalFinance",

I expected just a handful of people, but more than 40 players showed up and filled every slot to test our demo. In hindsight, bringing only two ROG Ally X devices was clearly not enough… I definitely underestimated the turnout! 😅\n\nThe feedback was incredibly insightful and it sparked a wave of new fans joining our Discord, already sharing art, ideas, and a ton of kindness. Moments like these remind me why we are building Tomo: Endless Blue. 💙\n\n(And yes, I may or may not have trolled the Pokémon AZ line by letting people play Tomo while waiting for their demo slot, then interviewing them after they had tried both 🤭)",

    "text": "Meet Théo – the designers behind GCast\n\nBefore joining us, Théo worked as an independent designer on the Game UI Design team of Humankind, the acclaimed 4X strategy game from Amplitude Studios.\n\nWith his eye for clarity and elegant details, he brings a strong vision of implicit, intuitive, and neat design to our product.\n\nHere’s what players had to say about the Humankind UI:\n\n“The basic User Interface (UI) is as neat as it gets. Yes, it has way too many features compared to a traditional Civilization game, but the UI simply makes much of the things self-explanatory.” \n“The UI does a lot to make the game quite visually appealing.” \n“If you are a game UI nerd like me, check it out.”\n\nWe’re excited to see Théo apply the same passion for thoughtful design to shaping the future of Gcast.",

    "text": "TLDR; 🎮 I built an autotesting framework from scratch, with PlayStation as the main client.\nWant to get autotesting coverage on your games or improve what you have? Let's talk!\n\nAfter attending the autotesting roundtables at the Game Developers Conference last year, I realized that the video game industry still relies almost entirely on manual testing. For many studios, the idea of having automated testing pipelines and scenarios seems too difficult or unattainable.\n\nBut here’s what I managed to do:\n\n- 🤖 Automate tests on a catalog of 5,000+ games across different environments, running on every commit.\n\n- 🧪 Create a farm of dev kits to test not only on PC, but also on the different consoles on the market.\n\n- ✅ Provide peace of mind to developers, as manual testers are unable to ensure non-regression with every single commit.\n\n- 🧑‍💻 Give both developers and QA teams an easy way to create their own tests and add them to the pipeline.\n\n- 🔬 Achieve a certain testing power by comparing images, audio, performance, logs, and more.\n\nUltimately, I had a blast doing this. It's rewarding to build solutions that are uncommon in the industry and see them work—and even realize there's a ton of untapped potential (yeah, I was doing this before ChatGPT, lol).\n\nI'd be really interested in applying my knowledge and experience to your games, whether you're using well-known or proprietary engines!\n\nIf this sounds interesting to you, or you just want to discuss it or compare experiences, I'd be happy to chat! Feel free to ping me on LinkedIn. 😁\n\n#GameDev #AutomatedTesting #QA #DevOps #VideoGames",

    "text": "Something I’ve noticed in my first few months here in Winnipeg is how everything is built with wood. It’s fast, flexible, and smells like progress. It’s beautiful. \n\nIt's also completely different from where I come from. 😉\n\nBack in Georgia, we build with stone. Our fortresses have stood for over a thousand years. Stone is about permanence, resilience, and deep, unshakeable foundations. It’s heavy. It’s slow. It’s meant to last forever. \n\nThis got me thinking about how we build companies and software. \n\nFor many years in IT, I've worked with both \"stone\" and \"wood\". \n\nStone is the legacy monolith, the critical database, the enterprise ERP system you customize... It's powerful and reliable, but a nightmare to change. \n\nWood is the agile microservice, the React front-end, the serverless function. You can build an MVP in weeks. You can pivot, adapt, and scale quickly. But it requires constant maintenance to weather the storms. \n\nI’ve seen leaders who only love stone, and their companies become fossils. I’ve seen leaders who only love wood, and their platforms collapse in the first high wind. 💨  \n\n💡 The real art is in the architecture. It's knowing how to reinforce a stone foundation with a flexible wooden frame. It’s about choosing the right material for the right job, ensuring the whole structure is sound, secure, and ready for the future. \n\nMy journey in Winnipeg feels a bit like this. I'm a \"stone\" guy learning to love the craft of building with \"wood.\" It’s a new environment and a new way of thinking. And I’m finding that the principles of building something strong, beautiful, and lasting are universal. \n\nWhat is your company built with? Stone, wood, or a hybrid of both? I'd love to hear your stories. \n\n#TechLeadership #CTO #SoftwareArchitecture #StartupLife #WinnipegTech #GeorgiaToCanada #Newcomer",
