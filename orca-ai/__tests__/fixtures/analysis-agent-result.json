      "content": "There are almost no explicit complaints, frustrations, or problem rants in the dataset — the public posts are strictly product announcements, tutorials, and demo invitations. For example, the five visible posts are promotional or instructional (e.g. \"I just open-sourced Mira — an Agentic AI system...\" https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7365639131323863040/; \"I just launched a YouTube channel to help business leaders use AI in simple, practical ways.\" https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7354433074971009024/). None of these contain language like \"frustrated\", \"problem\", or explicit complaints.\n\nComments authored by Dimi are functional (links to walkthrough videos and the GitHub repo) rather than venting: e.g. \"🔗 Full video walkthrough: https://youtu.be/NPTLzECkBT8  💻 GitHub repo: https://github.com/dimiMikadze/mira\" (comment on https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7365639131323863040/). Because the dataset contains no posts or comments that call out pain points directly, there isn’t evidence to extract specific recurring frustrations. What’s missing: issue-focused posts or criticism threads (e.g., posts titled \"I’m struggling with...\" or comments criticizing vendors/tools) would be required to identify concrete pain points."

      "content": "The account’s recent activity is clearly centered on agentic AI and practical AI tooling. Primary evidence: the top-performing post \"🚀 I just open-sourced Mira — an Agentic AI system that automates company research at scale.\" (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7365639131323863040/, Reactions: 26 | Comments: 2 | Reposts: 2) and the follow-up demo announcement \"Last month I shared the first version of Mira... I put together a short demo video\" (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7378306963828441088/, Reactions: 14 | Comments: 2).\n\nAlongside Mira, Dimi is producing educational content about practical AI usage (ChatGPT features, YouTube videos): see \"Just published a new YouTube video on some of the most useful ChatGPT features\" (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7358377857074577409/, Reactions: 19 | Comments: 4) and \"I just launched a YouTube channel to help business leaders use AI\" (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7354433074971009024/, Reactions: 14 | Comments: 3). He also links to technical artifacts (GitHub) in comments, reinforcing a build-and-teach focus (e.g., GitHub link in the comment on the Mira post: https://github.com/dimiMikadze/mira). Overall, the dominant themes are Agentic workflows (Mira), LLM application demos, and practical AI education for businesses."

Dimi explicitly frames Mira as \"Free, open source, and easy to customize\" in the open-source announcement (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7365639131323863040/), and he follows up posts with public GitHub links in comments (e.g., https://github.com/dimiMikadze/mira), signaling a value placed on sharing code and reproducibility.\n\nHe also emphasizes practical, business-focused usefulness over abstract research: the YouTube channel pitch is \"to help business leaders use AI in simple, practical ways\" (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7354433074971009024/) and the ChatGPT features post lists concrete workplace uses (\"review contracts, clean up spreadsheets, simulate client conversations...\") (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7361301965022150658/). These repeated messages show a consistent preference for practical, usable tooling and knowledge-sharing rather than closed-source or purely theoretical work."

The top post about Mira (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7365639131323863040/) attracted 26 reactions and likers include people such as [Goga Abramishvili](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAACF137YBndDn6gqYtZe7aouiMw-O0nwZUwA), [RIDDHIMAN DEBNATH](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAACo5yacB9Q3PIX5o7kVtwHXa1AVSK7uy6ZI) and [Irakli L.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABZZsv4BPHhKsA6gA5HOc8uep5MdFed73A4) (listed under reactions). Commenters include [RIDDHIMAN DEBNATH](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riddhiman-debnath-25b303179) who wrote \"🚀 Incredible progress, Dimi!\" — a direct two-way interaction on that post.\n\nDimi also actively reacts to many others’ posts (one-way engagement from him to peers). Examples: he reacted to [Irakli Davarashvili](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irakli-davarashvili)’s conference post (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7420405039845867521/) and to game/dev community posts like [Jules Testard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julestestard) (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7394705840869367808/). This pattern shows mutual engagement with a cluster of peers (likes/comments on his posts) plus proactive one-way engagement (his reactions) across local professional networks and technical/product communities. What’s missing: detailed mapping of follower overlap or frequency counts per contact to quantify influence intensity."

      "name": "Expertise",
      "content": "Evidence of technical depth appears primarily around the Mira project: the open-source announcement (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7365639131323863040/, Reactions: 26) is supported by concrete artifacts — multiple comments from Dimi linking to a GitHub repo (https://github.com/dimiMikadze/mira) and full walkthrough videos (e.g., https://youtu.be/NPTLzECkBT8 and https://youtu.be/z8HdHOMvoNY). Those links indicate hands-on engineering work and readiness to share implementation details, which is consistent with his \"Founding Software Engineer\" role and the About text stating platform scale experience.\n\nOther posts (ChatGPT features, YouTube how-to) are higher-level, practical tutorials rather than deep technical treatises. For example, \"If you’re using ChatGPT at work, these features are worth knowing. Quick breakdown in the slides.\" (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7361301965022150658/, Reactions: 4) suggests practical guidance rather than low-level technical explanation. In short: the strongest evidence of depth is Mira (code + demos); other content demonstrates applied knowledge and user-facing guidance rather than deep, technical threads or long-form engineering posts."

      "name": "Communication style",
      "content": "Dimi’s posts are concise, practical, and accessible, mixing short announcements with bullet-pointed lists and calls to action. Representative examples: the open-source Mira post is compact and promotional: \"🚀 I just open-sourced Mira — an Agentic AI system... Give it a website URL, get a full company profile in minutes.\" (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7365639131323863040/). The YouTube launch post uses bullets to list business use cases (\"Create content faster\n– Automate support\n– Summarize research…\") (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7354433074971009024/).\n\nTone and format are informal-to-professional, focused on utility: posts use emojis and direct CTAs (\"Link in the first comment below 👇\"). Dimi also uses short follow-up comments to add links (e.g., \"🔗 Full video walkthrough: https://youtu.be/NPTLzECkBT8  💻 GitHub repo: https://github.com/dimiMikadze/mira\"), showing a preference for brief main posts with technical detail supplied in comments. There are more statements and demonstrations than open questions; the feed is tutorial/announcement-oriented rather than conversational or investigative."

      "name": "Hidden interests",
      "content": "Reactions (likes) reveal interests that don’t appear in his own post copy: Dimi frequently reacts to conference, startup, and product posts from peers — suggesting attention to community events, product demos, and regional professional updates. Examples: he reacted to [Irakli Davarashvili](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irakli-davarashvili)’s ICE/conference post (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7420405039845867521/), to [Jules Testard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julestestard)’s gaming/dev trip post (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7394705840869367808/), and to operational/business updates like [Goga Gujejiani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/goga-gujejiani)’s warehouse post (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7419254355855441921/).\n\nThese reactions indicate instinctive support for peers’ milestones (events, product demos, operations) beyond the technical AI topics he posts about. Because reactions are low-effort and often spontaneous, they reveal an interest in community momentum, in-person events, and product/operations news that his curated posts (which focus on Mira and tutorials) do not foreground."

This indicates a strong match between stated identity and visible attention.\n\nOne notable emphasis that’s more visible in activity than in the short headline is content production and teaching: he launched a YouTube channel and published multiple walkthrough videos aimed at business leaders (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7354433074971009024/; https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7358377857074577409/). The About section mentions workflows and LLM applications but does not explicitly call out ongoing public content creation — producing and promoting educational videos appears as an additional, stronger time commitment in practice than the headline alone signals."

The pattern is clear in the dataset: audiences respond more to tangible product/news (open-source release + demo videos) than to short slide breakouts or tips alone."

      "content": "Within the available timeframe (July–September 2025) there is a clear progression from general AI education toward focused agentic-system development and iteration. Timeline evidence: July 25 — launched a YouTube channel to help business leaders use AI (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7354433074971009024/, Reactions: 14); August 5 — published a YouTube video on useful ChatGPT features (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7358377857074577409/, Reactions: 19); August 25 — open-sourced Mira (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7365639131323863040/, Reactions: 26); September 29 — posted a Mira demo update showing rapid growth of capabilities (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7378306963828441088/, Reactions: 14).\n\nWhat’s missing for a true 6‑month trend analysis: earlier posts (older than July 2025) or a denser time series. The dataset does not include activity from the six months prior to July, so longitudinal claims beyond July–September 2025 would be unsupported. Within the provided window, though, activity shifted from educational content to building, open-sourcing, and demoing an agentic AI project."
